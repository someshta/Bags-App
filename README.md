### Challenges and the future
* Currently there is a small bug involving user sessions! You may have to log out and refresh the page if you close your tab. We're working on it :)
* Text message notifications are only working for the creator of the app, as twilio charges a fee to use more than one phone number. We are hoping to convert BAGS to using push notifications soon, so our fans can really use this app!
